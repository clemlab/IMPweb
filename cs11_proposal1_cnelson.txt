Learning how to create a website using django.


The goal of this project would be to create a simple website that would accept
either entered into an interactive field or as a file a protein sequence (if
I have time sequences) and perform some calculation on it and return the result
of that calculation in an appropriate formet. The code for the calculation
would be provided to me, and shouldn't be considered part of the project 
as I will not be writing it. Ideally there would be multiple selections and a 
system for extending the code to cover different calculations. 

The code would be written in python using the Django framework. I am familiar
with python, but not with Django or web development in general. The code that
will run be run on the protein will use numpy and/or scipy. 


Risks:

Input sanitization. Ideally this would eventually be a public-facing website,
so having basic security precautions in place is necessary. 

I'm basically walking into web development blind. The Django project itself has
a tutorial I'm planning to follow for the first couple of weeks, but I'll need
to consult with the teachers to find out the unknown unknowns.

Implementation plan:

First Week:

First half of tutorial
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/
parts install-3

Second Week:

same tutorial
parts 4-7

Third Week:

Advanced tutorial
Simple field

Fourth Week:

Input sanitation
